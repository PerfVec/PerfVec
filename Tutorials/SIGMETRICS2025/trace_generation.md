# Prerequisite
## Prerequisite for Steps 1 - 2
Environment: personal laptop
1. Docker version >= 27.2.0

## Prerequisite for Step 3
Environment: server (with higher computing power for simulation)

# Step 1: Prepare a RISC-V cross compiler in Docker

A RISC-V cross compiler is likely needed for any non-RISC-V machine that you want to use for cross-compiling a RISC-V binary. 
Letâ€™s say you want to use your local laptop for RISC-V compilation, but it is not a RISC-V architecture machine.
Currently, we provide a reproducible and portable Docker container environment as a solution. The Docker image ```khsubnl/riscv_cross_compiler``` from DockerHub is a pre-built image: [https://hub.docker.com/r/khsubnl/riscv_cross_compiler](https://hub.docker.com/r/khsubnl/riscv_cross_compiler) (current size: 8.42 GB)
that contains a pre-compiled riscv cross compiler.

## Prepare your docker container locally

 - Install docker on your laptop.

    - For Mac: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)

    - For Windows: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
   
 - Clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PerfVec/PerfVec.git
   cd <path to PerfVec>
   ```

 - Use script to setup the docker container:
   ```
   cd scripts/Tutorials/2025_SIGMETRICS
   sh docker_pull_setup.sh 
   ```

 - Run the container in an interactive docker environment:
   ```
   sh docker_run.sh
   ```

You will then be logged into a Docker container environment that contains the RISC-V cross compiler ```riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc``` under ```/opt/riscv/bin/```.

Simply call ```/opt/riscv/bin/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc <any command>``` in this Docker container environment to cross-compile your target program.

Currently the Docker image is based on ubuntu20:04.

# Step 2: Cross compile HelloWorld source code

Now you are within the docker environment. 
Run cross compilation:
```
/opt/riscv/bin/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -static ./hello.c -o hello.riscvbin
```

Now the `hello.riscvbin` executable can be used for gem5 simulation.

# Step 3: Trace generation (gem5 simulation)

## 3.1 Prepare simulator

### 3.1.1 Clone ```gem5``` on your server.
```
git clone https://github.com/lingda-li/gem5.git
cd <Path to gem5>
git checkout riscv
```

### 3.1.2 Build gem5 simulator
```
scons build/RISCV/gem5.opt -j<N>
```
## 3.2 Launch gem5 simulation & trace generation
```
./build/RISCV/gem5.opt --trace_outdir <Output dir> configs/example/riscv/starter_se.py --cpu=minor <Path to executable>
```

For example,
```
./build/RISCV/gem5.opt --trace_outdir ./ configs/example/riscv/starter_se.py --cpu=minor ./hello.riscvbin 
```

There will be two output files, ```trace.txt``` and ```trace.sq.txt```. Refer to [trace.md](../trace.md) for more detail.

# Step 4: Model testing
Continue to the Jupyter Notebook on Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ViJtzsbbUFXkSEYsdgne9iJsfCZq0UvJ#scrollTo=96f_pEaCG1k5](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ViJtzsbbUFXkSEYsdgne9iJsfCZq0UvJ#scrollTo=96f_pEaCG1k5) 
for the hands-on activity about model prediction.
