## Trace generated by gem5

A short example instruction trace is included ([trace_example.sq.txt]() and
[trace_example.txt]()), where [trace_example.txt]() includes all instructions
and [trace_example.sq.txt]() includes all store instructions.
Each line is an instruction, and an instruction contains a bound of numbers.
To reason about these numbers, please see the function at
[https://github.com/lingda-li/gem5/blob/ml_sim/src/cpu/o3/dyn_inst.cc#L449](),
which prints out these numbers.
Use the 4th instruction in [trace_example.txt]() as an example,
```
0 -1 80500 120500 121000 1500 2500 3000 3000 47 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  1 549755747984 8 2 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0  4196460 0 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 0  1 1  0 42  0 1
```

These numbers are:

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether this instruction incurs a fault during execution.

<span style="color:blue">*-1*</span>: store queue index for store instructions, -1 for other instructions.

<span style="color:blue">*80500*</span>: when this instruction is fetched. All latencies here and below are in the unit of ps.

<span style="color:blue">*120500*</span>: how long it takes to get out of reorder buffer.

<span style="color:blue">*121000*</span>: how long it takes to retire (retire latency).

<span style="color:blue">*1500*</span>: decode latency.

<span style="color:blue">*2500*</span>: rename latency.

<span style="color:blue">*3000*</span>: dispatch latency.

<span style="color:blue">*3000*</span>: issue latency.

<span style="color:blue">*47*</span>: op class defined by gem5.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it is a micro operation.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it is a conditional branch.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it is an unconditional branch.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it is a direct branch.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it needs to squash instructions after it.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether instructions need to execute sequentially after it.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether instructions need to execute sequentially before it.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it is an atomic instruction.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it is a conditional store instruction.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it acts a barrier for memory read.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it acts a barrier for memory write.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it is a quiesce instruction.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it is a non speculative instruction.

<span style="color:blue">*1*</span>: whether it accesses memory.

<span style="color:blue">*549755747984*</span>: memory address it accesses.

<span style="color:blue">*8*</span>: memory size it accesses.

<span style="color:blue">*2*</span>: how many cache/memory levels it goes through to satisfy the request.

<span style="color:blue">*-1 -1 -1*</span>: Data MMU walking depths in case of DTLB miss.

<span style="color:blue">*0 0 0*</span>: Data MMU walking addresses in case of DTLB miss.

<span style="color:blue">*0 0 0*</span>: the number of cache writebacks due to data access in case of cache replacement.

<span style="color:blue">*4196460*</span>: program counter.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether it branches.

<span style="color:blue">*0*</span>: whether a branch is mis-predicted.

<span style="color:blue">*-1*</span>: how many cache/memory levels it goes through to fetch the instruction.

<span style="color:blue">*-1 -1 -1*</span>: Instruction MMU walking depths in case of ITLB miss.

<span style="color:blue">*0 0 0*</span>: Instruction MMU walking addresses in case of ITLB miss.

<span style="color:blue">*0 0*</span>: the number of cache writebacks due to instruction fetch in case of cache replacement.

<span style="color:blue">*1 1*</span>: the number of source and destination registers, which decides how many registers are listed behind them.

<span style="color:blue">*0 42*</span>: the category and index of the first and only source register.

<span style="color:blue">*0 1*</span>: the category and index of the first and only destination register.
